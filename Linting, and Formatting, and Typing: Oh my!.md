## Description
All of its faults aside, no one sees JavaScript as a toy language any longer. But with all that said the faults of the language can't be easily overlooked, and lead to all manners of WatTF moments.

Fortunately, an ecosystem is developing around JavaScript to help smooth over these bumps. See how tools like ESLint, Flow, Prettier, and more begin to make JavaScript as powerful and safe as any other language.

### Notes
There are specific tools called out in the description, but some time will be devoted to the competitors to each of those tools to let people judge on their own. The overriding theme is around these tools making your code better not the tools themselves.
