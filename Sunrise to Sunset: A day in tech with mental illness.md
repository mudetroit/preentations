## Description
- Wake up, and contemplate getting out of bed for 15 minutes. Not because you are tired
- Combat thoughts of self-harm on your drive to work
- Start shaking on the walk from where you parked to your office; you are terrified this is the day you will be fired

You haven't even made it to work yet.

1 in 5 of us will suffer from a diagnosable mental illness this year, and those who are suffering are not immediately obvious. Learn what little things are happening for at least one person suffering from mental illness, how you might be able to help, and efforts being taken in our community to make the situation better.

### Notes
This talk is focused on taking the broad information people hear about mental illness, and tying it back real experiences from a person. Making the impersonal personal. I have previously taken a similar approach over my entire lifetime of dealing with mental illness, but by looking at it in the daily events we all go through I hope to make the struggle people deal with much more tangible to those who do not suffer from mental illness.
