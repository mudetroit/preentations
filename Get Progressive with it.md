## Description
Responsive web design! Mobile first! Hybrid apps! We are continuously bombarded with new ideas about the best way to develop a new application. For a small team, effectively delivering across many platforms can be a problem, but delivering a hybrid app frequently falls into an uncanny valley trap.

Enter Progressive Web Apps, your website now is truly installable as an application on a mobile device. Progressive web apps leverage newer Web APIs to allow you to interact on a deeper level with your client including offline support, notifications, and more. Learn the techniques for building a Progressive Web App, the new design considerations you should take into account when doing so, and how it lets you iterate quickly on new ideas.

### Notes
This is a deep dive into the APIs, architectural pieces, and design considerations for building a Progressive Web App. Because of this, it is marked as an intermediate level workshop; there won't be enough time to introduce more basic JS techniques necessary to complete the workshop exercises.
