## Description
Developers have adopted a number of techniques to help speed development of their products. Leveraging tests to help them design the interfaces to their underlying pieces (classes, functions, components, etc.). For a long time the interface between designers and developers has been a continual rough point. Traditional TDD doesn't work well in that environment, as the UI pieces need to be intentionally flexible and looking at the change of a string value tells you little about how it will actually look.

Enter Styleguide Driven Design, using the Styleguide as your test bed for developing new UI components can help the entire development team.

- It provides an easy place for developers to go when trying to add a new piece of functionality

- It provides a test bed for designers to see how a change will ripple across the application

- New tools allow us to easily detect all of the places that will be updated by a design change

Learn how to use Styleguide Driven Design to up your game.

### Notes
This talk is going to pick a certain set of tools to demonstrate these techniques (in this case React, Storybook, and a few related ones), but specific effort will be taken to show how these techniques can be applied to other tech stacks as well.
